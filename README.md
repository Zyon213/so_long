This project is a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements.

Being a developer is a great thing for creating your own game.
But a good game needs some good assets. In order to create 2D games, you will have
to search for tiles, tilesets, sprites, and sprite sheets.
Fortunately, some talented artists are willing to share their works on platforms like:
itch.io
